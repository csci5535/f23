However, these systems exhibit a significant amount of regularity in both structure and communication  which can be identified and leveraged to simplify the reasoning. We present a goal-directed abstract interpretation approach for the verification of distributed systems. This approach is implemented in Pâtissier, a framework for reasoning about safety properties of programs written in the P language."

    "text": "David Baines and Matt Buchholz: Improving convergence time in PL-focused LLMs in limited training data environments via optimized syntactical learning task selection\nLarge language models (LLMs) have gained popularity in recent years for aiding programmers in coding tasks, such as code generation and summarization. However, as new programming languages are continually introduced and adopted, existing code LLMs may not generalize well to unseen languages; further, existing code LLM training techniques, which typically rely on large amounts of data, may not be well-suited to an emerging, low-resource programming language. In this paper, we draw inspiration from models for low-resource natural languages (NLs); we explore how syntax-driven pre-training tasks can augment the performance of a code LLM on downstream tasks, and how the relative effectiveness of modified pre-training changes with the amount of data available. We demonstrate how these augmented training techniques can help bootstrap a code LLM for an emerging programming language, with the goal of reducing the barrier to developing tools for a new programming language (e.g. an autocomplete model for programming in said language)."

    "text": "Scott McCall and Zilong Li: Developing Programming Languages for Ease of Use with LLM’s\nIn this paper, we discuss the importance of prompting in large language models, and how performance on certain tasks greatly varies based on the quality and manner of the prompt itself, which can make interacting with these models difficult. Addressing these limitations is important due to the increased mainstream usage of large language models such as ChatGPT in a wide variety of contexts. The difficulty from improving the performance of these models comes from the billions of parameters that are used in these models, and the idea that fine-tuning them would be impractical for most users and impossible for models that are closed-source. Prompting is a good approach to retrieve satisfactory responses from large languages models, and it is user-friendly since using the natural language is enough. However, many prompting methods are associated with certain templates and the call of languages models’ APIs. Our goal is to develop a programming language that can interact with an LLM such as ChatGPT in a way such that constraints and other conditions can be added to the prompt such that it provides a layer of abstraction to the user that makes it easier to interact with the LLM in a way that provides higher quality results."

But, they come with their own set of rules that the developers must manually abide by. Without a strict compile time verification of those rules, there exist chances of subtle bugs, slower than expected performance issues and infinite re-rendering of the UI, which can occur completely unbeknownst to the developer until the app is actually run. In this paper, we try to model the behaviour of these hooks in terms of the React Concurrent Fiber Architecture to identify such bugs much earlier in the development cycle."

The proposal should explain what you expect to learn from the project (i.e., why is it interesting to you?) and should include a work schedule. Make sure to budget time for writing a short project paper (~10 pages) describing the project and for preparing a short (~15-20 minutes, depends on number of projects) project presentation during the last week of classes. The main purpose of the proposal is for me to give you feedback on its feasibility.\nThe main goal of the project is to allow you to customize the content of the course to your own interests. The goal is not to force you all to produce novel results in one semester. Course projects like this often lead to collaborations that eventually yield exciting research. In the hopefully-likely event that you end up enjoying your project, come see me about taking it further (say, to publication)."

    "text": "Project Kinds\nProjects on any subject related to the class are acceptable. The goal is to allow you to customize the project to your interests. There are two main types of projects: implementation projects, theory projects, and research projects.\nIn general, I recommend that you try to do a research project. They are typically a bit harder because they typically involve both theory and implementation.\nUndergraduate students may undertake implementation or theory projects but are free to pursue research projects. Graduate students must aim for a research project.\n\nImplementation Projects\nPick a fragment of a language or a relevant algorithm, and implement it! There is no firm limit on the amount of code.\nAn implementation project should feature “numbers”: controlled, experimental results that help to sway your audience in favor of a point you are making. You should actually have a point: “I implemented a register allocator” is not quite good enough. You will want something more like: “Graph-coloring register allocation yields fewer spills and thus smaller and faster code than greedy register allocation. On the X benchmarks for the Y architecture, replacing a greedy register allocator in the Z compiler with a graph-coloring one resulting in a A% decrease in code size and a B% decrease in average executing time.”\nYour implementation must be relevant to language design or analysis. It could also be relevant to language implementation, provided that it has sufficient conceptual content and is close enough to the course. Graph-coloring register allocation wouldn’t actually cut it.\n\n\nTheory Projects\nTheoretical projects are similar in spirit to implementation projects, except that they deliver a system of formal definitions and proofs rather than a collection of source code. Rather than evaluate the system empirically, using “numbers”, theory projects are evaluated based on what they prove.\n\n\nResearch Projects\nThere are many kinds of research projects, including the following:\n\nDesign and implement a program analysis\nInvent a language or a language feature for some particular purpose or with some particular characteristic (e.g., to make program analysis and understanding more tractable)\nTry to formalize some interesting aspect of some existing language\nExplore novel techniques for implementing a given language fragment\n\nThese projects are harder because they always involve some survey work and often involve some implementation. If you want to do a research project, and you are not yet sufficiently familiar with the area of the project, you should start with a brief survey and then turn it into a research project. While research is necessarily open-ended, be sure that you have a well-defined goal for the end of the semester so that you have something to write up and present."

The goal here is to help you refine the connection with your project in the form of a “mini-project proposal.” It is a bit less involved than the Project Proposal, as you do not need to lay out the full landscape of related work.\nYou may consult slides or recordings from the authors’ for the paper your presenting, but you must speak from your perspective (and thus need to make your own slides).\nLogistically,\n\nShare a link to the paper with the class in advance (by the end of the week before your presentation).\nSign up for a presentation slot.\nSubmit your slides before your presentation."

    "text": "The Presentation\nThe presentation should be short and should describe what the problem was, what the difficulties were, and what was accomplished or learned. You will find it much easier to prepare the talk using slides (perhaps 8 to 12 slides, depending on your speed).\nWhile preparing the talk keep in mind who your audience is. You will be presenting to colleagues who are eager to find out (1) about new exciting facets of compilation and (2) how much fun you had. Plan to motivate the project (i.e., why is this important?) and to describe what you learned from it. Keep in mind that your colleagues have not read all the papers that you have read to do the project.\nProject presentations will be held on the final week of classes. Students presenting on Tuesday will receive a small amount of extra credit to make up for presenting earlier."

    "text": "The Paper\nYour write up at the end of the semester should be in the form of a short research paper. The project paper should have an abstract and an introduction describing the tackled problem, its motivation, and a very brief summary of the accomplishment. Then you should write a description of your notations (especially if they are different from what we used in class). Then you continue with the body of the material. The paper should end with a conclusion putting in perspective the accomplishment of the project and mentioning the open problems and with a bibliography of cited papers. Research papers should also have a related work section in which they compare the work with previous research results.\nYou might want to browse the papers from PLDI or POPL. Aside from giving you a number of data points for how the paper should look graphically, reading the electronic editions might help you to find a topic. Extending previously-published work is often not a bad start.\nYour project paper should be ~10 pages, as necessary, while being as concise and concrete as possible. Like your proposal, you will not be graded on length but on how many interesting things you say. You will turn in a PDF as well as your implementation code. You will want to use the LaTeX class file produced by ACM/SIGPLAN."
