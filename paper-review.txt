Directions

Use this form to evaluate and comment on this submission.  Your review will
consist of three parts: a brief summary, ratings, and detailed comments that
back up your ratings.  The author will receive your comments anonymously (i.e.,
your name will be removed).  If there are certain comments you would like to
convey to the instructor but do not wish to send to the author, please include
them in the "confidential comments" section.

Most papers will not represent finished products but rather good starts to
interesting projects.  Try to make your comments as constructive as possible to
help your peers improve their work.

Note that this review form is modeled after ones used at peer-reviewed research
conferences.

Detailed Comments

Please supply detailed comments to back up your rankings. These comments will be
forwarded to the author of the paper. The comments should guide the author in
making revisions for future iterations. Hence, the more detailed you make your
comments, the more useful your review will be for the author. A quality review
typically requires at least 500 words --- and is the standard expectation in a
conference peer-review.

Confidential Comments

You may wish to withhold some comments from the author, and include them solely
for the instructor. For example, you may want to express a very strong
(negative) opinion on the paper, which might offend the author in some way.  Or,
perhaps you wish to write something which would expose your identity to the
author. If you wish to share comments of this nature, this is the place to put
them.
